### Connect to JDBC 7 steps:
1.	Import the package
2.	Load and register the driver
3.	Allocate a connection object for connecting to the database
4.	create a statement object, based on the connection
5.	write sql query, execute query
6.	process the query result
7.	close the statement and connection object to free up the resources(use try with resource in step 3 and 4 to auto close(AutoCloseable interface))
