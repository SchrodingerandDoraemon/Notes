### JavaEE and Spring difference
Spring doesn't implement JavaEE specifications.      

### URL components
URI = scheme ":" ["//" authority] path ["?" query] ["#" fragment]

A fragment is an internal page reference, sometimes called a named anchor. It usually appears at the end of a URL and begi ns with a hash (#) character followed by an identifier. It refers to a section within a web page.

In HTML documents, the browser looks for an anchor tag with a name attribute matching the fragment.
